# many many unsuccesful trials in that part, but... everybody learns at their own tempo... Aren't they? : o

# first I had to install openpyxl into virtual env by typing into Terminal console
# cd ~/PycharmProjects/Project1
# pip3 install openpyxl
# (i also got the 'Cache entry deserialization failed, entry ignored' msg before installation,
# but then it's been Successfully installed. Anybody know what that warn means?
# I could also just install package into default python3 dir but... I didn't knew how to make PyCharm use it
# rather her own venv xd
# So in those two cases I'm open to suggestions.

# hm... now it tells me that there is ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openpyxl'
# so I uninstall what I tough I installed through ubuntu Terminal and try to install by PyCharm Terminal
# and now it seems to work

# we can access cells similar to pandas by bracket notation [] as well as method .cell() which however may be
# more reliable because it uses only integers to indicate cell's position in the worksheet
# notation based on letters may be tricky after 26th column, because once we've got no more letters in the alphabeth
# columns are signed with two or more letters:
print(sheet3['Z1'].column, sheet3['ZA1'].column, sheet3['DD1'].column)
# as Z is perceived as 26th letter ZA means that we passed whole alphabeth 26 times (677/26=26) so
# ZA is 677th column. Another A for ['ZAA1'] require to multiplicate 677 another 26 times... Just for curiosity
# one more example: DD1 will be 108th column, becouse it is 4 times 26 and plus another 4 :)
