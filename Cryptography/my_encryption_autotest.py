# Thanks to Al Sweigart for this and many other Python exercises and projects ideas

# Because I wanted to code by myself as much as possible to avoid temptation
# for cheating and just copying I scrupulously omitted large parts of the book...
# simultaneously having about zero knowledge in the cryptography field.
# In consequence, excited about encrypting my messages, I didn't knew i.a that
# the crucial for hacking-resistance is the key... I introduced completely
# redundant tricks (like .replace(" ","%") - because cipher without spaces seemed to look
# more spectacular...) and then wasted a lots of time in other parts of project (my_hacker, encryption_autotest)
# dealing with them. Maybe I learned even more because of that, maybe not... but remember...
"""
A cipher is secure only if everything but the key can be revealed while still keeping the message a secret.
You cannot rely on a cryptanalystâ€™s not having access to the same encryption software or not knowing which cipher you used.
Always assume that the enemy knows the system!
